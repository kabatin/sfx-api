"""The backend contract: how a sound-effect engine is driven.

A backend receives a backend-neutral :class:`GenerationRequest` and returns raw WAV files. It
chooses everything engine-specific — model files, steps, guidance — itself. It
never sees HTTP, client schemas or client-chosen paths, and its own output (logs, error text)
never reaches clients unredacted. Swapping the backend must not change the HTTP contract.
